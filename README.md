# about-me
***201 Lab 2 assignment***  
An About Me website with a quiz! The user should be asked their name and the website should "appear" to be talking to them via question and response. There is real time feedback so the user knows if they've gotten the answer correct, incorrect, or provided an invalid response. At the end, the user receives their final score and some commentary (depending on how they did) via an alert. All questions wrapped in functions that are invoked at the end of the JS code.
Photo gallery at the bottom of the page provides a bit more interaction, as photos colorize and enlarge when the user's mouse hovers over them, a descriptor pops up to tell the user who is in the photo.
Additionally, I've added a dynamic greeting (based on time of day and user's name) at teh bottom of the page, in addition to a tally of their final score. 
The page has a soft green color palette, hyperlinks to relevant sites, and a footer with a link to email me, visit my LinkedIn page, or check out my GitHub profile.

## Reflections and Comments
* Adding comments at the top of code to remind myself what I'm planning to do is a VERY helpful organization trip. Plan. Then do.
