    <h3>Early life and family</h3>
    <p>Although I'm originally from Sacramento, CA, I know live in the suburbs of Seattle, WA. I've lived in California,
      Idaho, Oregon, and Washingon. I have an idential twin and one younger sister. My partner and I have two children
      (ages 12 and 9) and love to learn new things.</p>

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p><b>Master of Business Administration, Marketing and General Management</b>, University of Calfornia, Davis <br>

    <b>Bachelor of Arts in English Literature</b>, University of California, Berkeley</p>

    <p>Additionally, I've gone through Whitewater Raft Guide and Swiftwater Rescue training, completed multiple <abbr title="National Outdoor Leadership School">NOLS</abbr> courses (Semester in the Rockies, Mountaineering Instructor Course, and Wilderness First Responder). I was also a member of <abbr title="Outdoor Industry Association">OIA</abbr>'s 2016 <a href="https://outdoorindustry.org/skip-yowell-future-leadership-academy/" target="_blank">Skip Yowell Future Leadership Program</a>.</p>

    <p>Currently I am a software development student at <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/" target="_blank"> Code
        Fellows</a>in Seattle, WA.</p>

    <h3>Career</h3>
    <p>I have deep experience in the world of "experiential products," having worked in wine, adventure travel, and
      outdoor recreation and education. My most recent roles at REI involved an intrapreneurial approach to new projects
      and initiatives within a multi-faceted organization and an agile approach to strategic localization and regional
      relevancy across the nation.</p>

    <p>I'm a strategic business development leader with a passion for the experiential product space. My specialty is
      helping businesses innovate through exploration and testing of creative solutions, new ventures, and surprising
      partnerships. I’ve been successful because of my ability to quickly form meaningful relationships, inspire and
      lead teams, and draw upon my unique background as an adventure travel guide. Because of my years delivering
      high-end front-line customer service, I maintain a laser-focus on the customer with every project and initiative.
      I’m always looking to acquire new skills and am currently feeding that passion by learning how to code.</p>
